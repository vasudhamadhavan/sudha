In Thanedar, walking up the slopes bordering the vast Apple orchards, I meet this gentle, arrestingly beautiful 94 yr. old Himachali, Pushpa, in her traditional skirt gathered around her and the familiar head scarf; with a skin the colour a mellow parchment of white gold, who on my asking for permission to take a photograph of her, wrinkles her nose and asks in her lilting voice, "photoo kab Milega?"

I promise to take a printout and hand her the next day. For me she represents the hillsides and all that they stand for.

And I know I have to paint her...
