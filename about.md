Sudha Madhavan specialises in the classical school of art and her much favoured subjects are derived from her travels. She picks the subjects for her art work from those remarkable experiences from her travels that have moved her and have a story to tell. She thus captures the essence of the places she travels to and the people she meets during her journeys in her art and as such, each of her works is representative and an entirely authentic expression.

Each artwork presented in this collection has taken an average of 3-4 months to create, and is a labor of love. To complete her own experience as well as satiate the viewer's curiosity, she accompanies almost all her pieces with verses written by her and anecdotal details about each subject.

Sudha has been an Educator and Consultant with leading NGO’s like Maya Organic, a livelihood development initiative involved in developing a network of artisans, workers and micro-entrepreneurs and Shishu Mandir, a children’s welfare institution founded by Hella Mundhra. Sudha has worked with young people and Women’s Self-help groups, involving herself in counselling and fundraising as well. She is also a Freelance Journalist, having been published in the Deccan Herald and The Hindu for the past 10 years. Sudha attended St. Thomas School, Shimla and studied English Literature and Education at Isabella Thoburn College and Lucknow University respectively.
