Sudha Madhavan specialises in the classical school of art and her much favoured subjects are derived from her travels. She picks the subjects for her art work from those remarkable experiences from her travels that have moved her and have a story to tell. She thus captures the essence of the places she travels to and the people she meets during her journeys in her art and as such, each of her works is representative and an entirely authentic expression.

Each artwork presented in this collection has taken an average of 3-4 months to create, and is a labor of love. To complete her own experience as well as satiate the viewer's curiosity, she accompanies almost all her pieces with verses written by her and anecdotal details about each subject.
