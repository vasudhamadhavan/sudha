I speak volumes and in silence yet.

Each twinkle, each wrinkle and line revel,

In stories dormant in my soul,

Soft sighs of quiet battles won,

Wings of mirth, sorrow and joy,

Endless lanes of forgotten tales,

Some cherished and others forgiven!

I carry within the essence of all.

I am the being and the bygone,

I am the She, the woman, I.
