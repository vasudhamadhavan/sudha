I watch as fickle time passes on 

Standing as an oak among my tribe...

 The wind caresses memories of the past

 And carries me on a distant ride 

Where under the watchful 'Risums' gaze 

I frolicked around as a boisterous child

 Among the yak herd's tinkling bells

 Among the green tinted chilly dales 

Where the Ha Chu flowed and as does now

 And shall flow for times to come..
